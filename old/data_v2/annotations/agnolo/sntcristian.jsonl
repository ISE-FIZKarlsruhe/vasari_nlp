{"id":608,"text":"To one Michele d'Agnolo of Poggibonzi, in the village of Montorsoli, which is three miles distant from Florence on the road to Bologna, where he had a good farm of some size, there was born a male child, to whom he gave the name of his father, Agnolo. That child, growing up, and having an inclination for design, as could be readily seen, was placed by his father, according to the advice of friends, to learn stone-cutting under some masters who worked at the quarries of Fiesole, almost opposite to Montorsoli. Agnolo continuing to ply the chisel with those masters, in company with Francesco del Tadda, who was then a lad, and with others, not many months had passed before he knew very well how to handle the tools and to execute many kinds of work in that profession. Having then contracted a friendship by means of Francesco del Tadda with Maestro Andrea, a sculptor of Fiesole, the genius of the child so pleased that master, that he conceived an affection for him, and began to teach him; and thus he kept him in his workshop for three years. After which time, his father Michele being dead, Agnolo went off in company with other young stone-cutters to Rome, where, having been set to work on the building of S. Pietro, he carved some of those rosettes that are in the great cornices which encircle the interior of that temple, with much profit to himself and a good salary. Having then departed from Rome, I know not why, he placed himself in Perugia with a master stone-cutter, who at the end of a year left him in charge of all his works. But, recognizing that to stay at Perugia was not the life for him, and that he was not learning, he went off, when the opportunity to depart presented itself, to work on the tomb of M. Raffaello Maffei, called Il  Volterrano, at Volterra; and in that work, which was being made in marble, he carved some things which showed that his genius was destined some day to achieve a good result.","label":[[7,37,"PER"],[27,37,"GPE"],[46,53,"GPE"],[46,67,"GPE"],[103,111,"GPE"],[127,134,"GPE"],[142,144,"PRON"],[156,160,"FAC"],[197,202,"PER"],[212,214,"PRON"],[232,235,"PRON"],[236,242,"PER"],[244,250,"PER"],[257,262,"PER"],[306,312,"PROD"],[354,357,"PRON"],[358,364,"PER"],[393,400,"PER"],[411,424,"TECH"],[436,443,"PER"],[474,481,"GPE"],[502,512,"GPE"],[514,520,"PER"],[543,549,"PROD"],[561,568,"PER"],[586,605,"PER"],[622,625,"PER"],[678,680,"PRON"],[714,719,"PROD"],[749,753,"PROD"],[822,841,"PER"],[847,854,"PER"],[847,884,"PER"],[865,873,"PER"],[877,884,"GPE"],[904,909,"PER"],[926,932,"PER"],[939,941,"PRON"],[969,972,"PRON"],[993,996,"PRON"],[1007,1009,"PRON"],[1015,1018,"PRON"],[1026,1034,"FAC"],[1035,1050,"TIME"],[1070,1073,"PRON"],[1081,1088,"PER"],[1101,1107,"PER"],[1145,1158,"PER"],[1162,1166,"GPE"],[1206,1214,"FAC"],[1218,1227,"FAC"],[1253,1261,"PROD"],[1284,1292,"PROD"],[1329,1335,"FAC"],[1410,1414,"GPE"],[1432,1434,"PRON"],[1453,1460,"GPE"],[1468,1474,"PER"],[1475,1487,"PER"],[1519,1522,"PRON"],[1540,1543,"PRON"],[1544,1549,"PROD"],[1584,1591,"GPE"],[1613,1616,"PRON"],[1627,1629,"PRON"],[1648,1650,"PRON"],[1702,1708,"PRON"],[1721,1937,"WORK"],[1725,1729,"FAC"],[1733,1775,"PER"],[1780,1788,"GPE"],[1802,1806,"PROD"],[1832,1838,"MAT"],[1840,1842,"PRON"],[1880,1883,"PRON"]]}
