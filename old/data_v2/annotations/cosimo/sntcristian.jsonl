{"id":646,"text":"While Giorgione and Correggio, to their own great credit and glory, were honouring the regions of Lombardy, Tuscany, on her part, was not wanting in men of beautiful intellect; among whom, not one of the least was Piero, the son of one Lorenzo, a goldsmith, and a pupil of Cosimo Rosselli, after whom he was always called Piero di Cosimo, and known by no other name. And in truth, when a man teaches us excellence and gives us the secret of living rightly, he deserves no less gratitude from us, and should be held no less as a true father, than he who begets us and gives us life and nothing more. Piero was entrusted by his father, who saw in his son a lively intelligence and an inclination to the art of design, to the care of Cosimo, who took him with no ordinary willingness; and seeing him grow no less in ability than in years, among the many disciples that he had, he bore him love as to a son, and always held him as such. This young man had by nature a most lofty spirit, and he was very strange, and different in fancy from the other youths who were working with Cosimo in order to learn the same art. He was at times so intent on what he was doing, that when some subject was being discussed, as often happens, at the end of the discussion it was necessary to go back to the beginning and tell him the whole, so far had his brain wandered after some other fancy of his own. And he was likewise so great a lover of solitude, that he knew no pleasure save that of going off by himself with his thoughts, letting his fancy roam and building his castles in the air. Right good reason had Cosimo, his master, for wishing him well, seeing that he made so much use of him in his works, that very often he caused him to execute  things of great importance, knowing that Piero had a more beautiful manner, as well as better judgment, than himself.","label":[[6,15,"PER"],[20,29,"PER"],[34,39,"PRON"],[87,94,"GPE"],[87,106,"GPE"],[108,115,"GPE"],[120,123,"PRON"],[149,152,"PER"],[214,288,"PER"],[225,228,"PER"],[236,256,"PER"],[264,269,"PER"],[273,288,"PER"],[301,303,"PRON"],[322,337,"PER"],[388,391,"PER"],[400,402,"PRON"],[457,459,"PRON"],[492,494,"PRON"],[533,539,"PER"],[546,548,"PRON"],[560,562,"PRON"],[573,575,"PRON"],[599,604,"PER"],[622,625,"PRON"],[626,632,"PER"],[645,648,"PRON"],[649,652,"PER"],[708,714,"PROD"],[731,737,"PER"],[748,751,"PRON"],[793,796,"PRON"],[851,860,"PER"],[866,868,"PRON"],[882,885,"PRON"],[899,902,"PER"],[920,923,"PRON"],[944,947,"PER"],[987,989,"PRON"],[1046,1052,"PER"],[1075,1081,"PER"],[1114,1116,"PRON"],[1148,1150,"PRON"],[1253,1255,"PRON"],[1307,1310,"PRON"],[1333,1336,"PRON"],[1378,1381,"PRON"],[1391,1393,"PRON"],[1442,1444,"PRON"],[1488,1495,"PRON"],[1501,1504,"PRON"],[1523,1526,"PRON"],[1551,1554,"PRON"],[1555,1562,"FAC"],[1597,1603,"PER"],[1605,1608,"PRON"],[1629,1632,"PRON"],[1651,1653,"PRON"],[1674,1677,"PRON"],[1681,1684,"PRON"],[1685,1690,"PROD"],[1708,1710,"PRON"],[1718,1721,"PRON"],[1775,1780,"PER"],[1843,1850,"PRON"]]}
