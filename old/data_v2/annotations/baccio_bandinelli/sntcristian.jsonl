{"id":627,"text":"In the days when the arts of design flourished in Florence by the favour and assistance of the elder Lorenzo de' Medici the Magnificent, there lived in the city a goldsmith called Michelagnolo di Viviano of Gaiuole, who worked excellently well at chasing and incavo for enamels and niello, and was very skilful in every sort of work in gold and silver plate. This Michelagnolo had a great knowledge of jewels, and set them very well; and on account of his talents and his versatility all the foreign masters of his art used to have recourse to him, and he gave them hospitality, as well as to the young men of the city, insomuch that his workshop was held to be, as it was, the first in Florence. Of him the Magnificent Lorenzo and all the house of Medici availed themselves; and for the tourney that Giuliano, the brother of that Magnificent Lorenzo, held on the Piazza di S. Croce, he executed with subtle craftsmanship all the ornaments of helmets, crests, and devices. Wherefore he acquired a great name and much intimacy with the sons of the Magnificent Lorenzo, to whom his work was ever afterwards very dear, and no less useful to him their acquaintance and friendship, by reason of which, and also by the many works that he executed throughout the whole city and dominion, he became a man of substance as well as one of much repute in his art. To this Michelagnolo the Medici, on their departure from Florence in the year 1494, entrusted much plate in silver and gold, which was all kept in safe hiding by him and faithfully preserved until their return, when he was much extolled by them for his fidelity, and afterwards recompensed with rewards. In the year 1487 there was born to Michelagnolo a son, whom he called Bartolommeo, but afterwards, according to the Florentine custom, he was called by everyone Baccio. Michelagnolo, desiring to leave his son heir to his art and connection, took him into his own workshop in company with other young men who were learning to draw; for that was the custom in those times, and no one was held to be a good goldsmith who was not a good draughtsman and able to work well in relief.","label":[[0,135,"TIME"],[21,25,"PROD"],[29,35,"PROD"],[50,58,"GPE"],[101,135,"PER"],[113,119,"ORG"],[156,160,"GPE"],[163,172,"PER"],[180,214,"PER"],[196,203,"PER"],[207,214,"GPE"],[247,254,"TECH"],[259,265,"TECH"],[270,277,"PROD"],[282,288,"PROD"],[336,340,"MAT"],[345,351,"MAT"],[352,357,"PROD"],[364,376,"PER"],[402,408,"PROD"],[418,422,"PRON"],[452,455,"PRON"],[468,471,"PRON"],[500,507,"PER"],[511,514,"PRON"],[515,518,"PROD"],[544,547,"PRON"],[553,555,"PRON"],[603,606,"PER"],[614,618,"GPE"],[634,637,"PRON"],[638,646,"FAC"],[666,668,"PRON"],[687,695,"GPE"],[700,703,"PRON"],[708,727,"PER"],[740,745,"ORG"],[740,755,"ORG"],[764,774,"PRON"],[801,809,"PER"],[815,822,"PER"],[831,850,"PER"],[864,882,"FAC"],[874,882,"GPE"],[884,886,"PRON"],[908,921,"PROD"],[930,939,"PROD"],[943,950,"PROD"],[952,958,"PROD"],[964,971,"PROD"],[983,985,"PRON"],[1035,1039,"PER"],[1047,1066,"PER"],[1076,1079,"PRON"],[1080,1084,"PROD"],[1138,1141,"PRON"],[1218,1223,"PROD"],[1229,1231,"PRON"],[1262,1266,"GPE"],[1271,1279,"GPE"],[1281,1283,"PRON"],[1293,1296,"PER"],[1343,1346,"PRON"],[1347,1350,"PROD"],[1360,1383,"PER"],[1377,1383,"ORG"],[1409,1417,"GPE"],[1418,1434,"TIME"],[1451,1456,"PROD"],[1460,1466,"MAT"],[1471,1475,"MAT"],[1514,1517,"PRON"],[1549,1554,"PRON"],[1568,1570,"PRON"],[1601,1604,"PRON"],[1656,1672,"TIME"],[1691,1703,"PER"],[1706,1709,"PER"],[1716,1718,"PRON"],[1726,1737,"PER"],[1772,1782,"GPE"],[1783,1789,"PROD"],[1791,1793,"PRON"],[1817,1823,"PER"],[1825,1837,"PER"],[1857,1860,"PRON"],[1861,1864,"PER"],[1873,1876,"PRON"],[1877,1880,"PER"],[1902,1905,"PRON"],[1911,1914,"PRON"],[1919,1927,"FAC"],[1956,1959,"PER"],[2004,2010,"PROD"],[2060,2069,"PER"],[2089,2100,"PER"],[2126,2132,"TECH"]]}
