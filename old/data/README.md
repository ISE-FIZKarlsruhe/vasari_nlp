# Evaluation data for Entity Linking on Art History literature

This evaluation dataset provides a set of sentences in English and Italian taken from two different editions of *Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects* by Giorgio Vasari. This evaluation dataset was created for evaluating different Entity Linking tools on Art History literature.<br/>

The editions referred to are:

* **IT**: Giorgio Vasari. Le Vite de' Piu Eccellenti Pittori, Scultori, et Architettori (1. ed. 1550). Einaudi (2000). [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/vitedepiueccellentipittoriscultoriedarchitettilegiorgiovasari) \[OCR transcribed\]
* **EN**: Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects. Translated by Gaston du C. De Vere from the 1568 edition. Macmillan and the Medici Society (1912-1915). [Project Gutenberg](https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/metabook?id=livespainters) \[Digital transcription\]


## Norms for the annotation
We annotated Named Entities mentioned in a text by using [Doccano](https://github.com/doccano/doccano). Entity spans are annotated with 4 types: **PER**, **LOC**, **ORG**, **MISC**. 

### Special issues

* We do not consider overlapping entities. We solved the problems of nested entities by considering only the longest surface form (SF); which therefore leads to the minimum number of entities in the annotation.
* Multiword expressions, i.e. noun phrases, were annotated only if they appear as a valid Surface Form of an entity, which means: a) they are present in the considered Knowledge Base (KB), i.e. Wikidata, as one of the labels, or b) they are slight lexical variations of the SFs present in the KB which employ direct synonyms of the words in the original SFs and do not need coreference resolution.
* Creative works which appear with the same SF of their subject are annotated only if they are actually referring to a singular object, e.g. they are introduced by a determinative article (*The Last Supper*).
* This dataset does not take into account coreference resolution. If a sequence of words refers to a named entity which is earlier or later mentioned in the context of the sentence, but this sequence of words is not a valid SF of the entity, then the sequence is mapped to an available candidate for the related concept in Wikidata.

## Details

In order to remove errors derived from OCR transcriptions from the Italian text, we preliminarily applied regular expression to the sampled sentences. More specifically, 1) we automatically removed whitespaces between First Name initials and the rest of the name, and 2) we added whitespaces between two merged nouns which were both capitalized. In the first step, we do not remove whitespace if the uppercase letter is at the beginning of the sentence or at a word-boundary.
