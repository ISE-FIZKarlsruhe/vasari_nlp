# Evaluation data for Entity Linking on Art History literature

This evaluation dataset provides a set of sentences in English and Italian taken from two different editions of *Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects* by Giorgio Vasari. This evaluation dataset was created for evaluating different Entity Linking tools on Art History literature.<br/>

The editions referred to are:

* **IT**: Giorgio Vasari. Le Vite de' Piu Eccellenti Pittori, Scultori, et Architettori (1. ed. 1550). Einaudi (2000). [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/vitedepiueccellentipittoriscultoriedarchitettilegiorgiovasari) \[OCR transcribed\]
* **EN**: Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors and Architects. Translated by Gaston du C. De Vere from the 1568 edition. Macmillan and the Medici Society (1912-1915). [Project Gutenber](https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/metabook?id=livespainters) \[Digital transcription\]


## Norms for the annotation
We annotated Named Entities mentioned in a text by using [Doccano](https://github.com/doccano/doccano). Entity spans are annotated with 5 types: **PER**, **LOC**, **ORG**, **MISC**, and **WORK**. The last type, introduced in this dataset, serves the purpose of annotating *Creative Works* explicitly mentioned in a text. Each entity span is subsequently disambiguated by linking it to the corresponding Wikidata entity.<br/>
A specific named entity is considered in our annotation if:
* It's a Person (either fictional or real), a natural or geographical space, a human-made facility, an organization, an artistic subject (either a character or an event), or a creative work.
* It has a related Wikipedia page.<br/>

In this evaluation dataset, we do not consider overlapping entities. We solved the problems of nested entities by considering only the longest surface form. However, many artworks are mentioned in the text by using a surface form which denotes also their subject. For this specific case, we considered multiple entities, i.e. the subject and the artwork, to be the correct entities to link.<br/>
