{"id":653,"text":"There is now living in Rome one who is certainly very excellent in his profession, Girolamo Siciolante of Sermoneta, of whom, although something has been said in the Life of Perino del Vaga, whose disciple he was, assisting him in the works of Castel S. Angelo and in many others, nevertheless it cannot but be well to say also here so much as his great excellence truly deserves. Among the first works, then, that this Girolamo executed by himself, was an altar-piece twelve palms high painted by him in oils at the age of twenty, which is now in the Badia of S. Stefano, near his native town of Sermoneta; wherein, large as life, are S. Peter, S. Stephen, and S. John the Baptist, with certain children. After that altar-piece, which was much extolled, he painted for the Church of S. Apostolo, in Rome, an altar-piece in oils with the Dead Christ, Our Lady, S. John, the Magdalene, and other figures, all executed with diligence. Then in the Pace, in the marble chapel that Cardinal Cesis caused to be constructed, he decorated the whole vaulting with stucco-work in a pattern of four pictures, painting therein the Nativity of Jesus Christ, the Adoration of the Magi, the Flight into Egypt, and the Massacre of the Innocents; all which was a work worthy of much praise and executed with invention, judgment, and diligence. For that same church, not long after, the same Girolamo painted an altar-piece fifteen palms high, which is beside the high-altar, of the Nativity of Jesus Christ, which was very beautiful; and then in another altar-piece in oils, for the Sacristy of the Church of S. Spirito in Rome, the Descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles, which is a work full of grace. In like manner, in the Church of S. Maria de Anima, the church of the German colony, he painted in fresco the whole of the Chapel of the Fugger family (for which  Giulio Romano once executed the altar-piece), with large scenes of the Life of Our Lady. For the high-altar of S. Jacopo degli Spagnuoli he painted in a large altar-piece a very beautiful Christ on the Cross with some Angels about Him, Our Lady, and S. John, and besides this two large pictures that are one on either side of it, each nine palms high and with a single figure, S. James the Apostle and S. Alfonso the Bishop; in which pictures it is evident that he used much study and diligence.","label":[[23,27,"GPE"],[67,70,"PRON"],[83,115,"PER"],[106,115,"GPE"],[166,170,"PROD"],[174,189,"PER"],[197,205,"PER"],[206,208,"PRON"],[224,227,"PRON"],[235,240,"PROD"],[244,250,"FAC"],[244,260,"FAC"],[251,260,"PER"],[294,296,"PRON"],[344,347,"PRON"],[397,402,"PROD"],[420,428,"PER"],[441,448,"PRON"],[454,704,"WORK"],[457,468,"PROD"],[498,501,"PRON"],[505,509,"TECH"],[524,530,"TIME"],[552,557,"FAC"],[552,571,"FAC"],[561,571,"PER"],[578,581,"PRON"],[589,593,"GPE"],[589,606,"GPE"],[636,644,"PER"],[636,704,"MOTIF"],[646,656,"PER"],[662,681,"PER"],[674,681,"PER"],[696,704,"PER"],[696,704,"PER"],[717,728,"PROD"],[755,757,"PRON"],[774,780,"FAC"],[774,804,"FAC"],[784,795,"MYTH"],[800,804,"GPE"],[806,931,"WORK"],[809,820,"PROD"],[824,828,"TECH"],[838,849,"MYTH"],[838,902,"MOTIF"],[843,849,"MYTH"],[851,859,"MYTH"],[861,868,"MYTH"],[874,883,"MYTH"],[895,902,"PROD"],[945,949,"FAC"],[958,964,"MAT"],[965,971,"FAC"],[977,985,"MYTH"],[977,991,"MYTH"],[1018,1020,"PRON"],[1041,1049,"LOC"],[1055,1066,"TECH"],[1072,1079,"PROD"],[1088,1096,"PROD"],[1115,1143,"WORK"],[1119,1143,"MOTIF"],[1119,1143,"MYTH"],[1131,1143,"MYTH"],[1145,1170,"WORK"],[1149,1170,"MOTIF"],[1149,1170,"MYTH"],[1166,1170,"MYTH"],[1172,1193,"WORK"],[1176,1193,"MOTIF"],[1176,1193,"MYTH"],[1188,1193,"GPE"],[1199,1228,"WORK"],[1203,1228,"MOTIF"],[1203,1228,"MYTH"],[1246,1250,"PROD"],[1341,1347,"FAC"],[1374,1382,"PER"],[1391,1489,"WORK"],[1394,1405,"PROD"],[1446,1456,"LOC"],[1465,1489,"MYTH"],[1477,1489,"MYTH"],[1537,1548,"PROD"],[1552,1556,"TECH"],[1566,1574,"LOC"],[1582,1588,"FAC"],[1582,1610,"FAC"],[1592,1602,"MYTH"],[1606,1610,"GPE"],[1612,1691,"WORK"],[1616,1660,"MOTIF"],[1616,1660,"MYTH"],[1631,1642,"MYTH"],[1652,1660,"PER"],[1716,1722,"FAC"],[1716,1776,"FAC"],[1726,1743,"PER"],[1749,1755,"FAC"],[1763,1776,"ORG"],[1778,1780,"PRON"],[1792,1798,"TECH"],[1816,1822,"FAC"],[1816,1843,"FAC"],[1830,1843,"ORG"],[1856,1869,"PER"],[1888,1899,"PROD"],[1907,1943,"WORK"],[1913,1919,"PROD"],[1927,1943,"MOTIF"],[1935,1943,"PER"],[1953,1963,"FAC"],[1967,1976,"PER"],[1967,1992,"FAC"],[1993,1995,"PRON"],[2015,2026,"PROD"],[2027,2113,"WORK"],[2044,2050,"PER"],[2044,2113,"MOTIF"],[2058,2063,"PROD"],[2074,2080,"PRON"],[2092,2100,"PER"],[2106,2113,"PER"],[2142,2150,"PROD"],[2233,2253,"MOTIF"],[2233,2253,"PER"],[2233,2253,"WORK"],[2246,2253,"PER"],[2258,2279,"MOTIF"],[2258,2279,"PER"],[2258,2279,"WORK"],[2273,2279,"PER"],[2290,2298,"PROD"],[2318,2320,"PRON"]]}
