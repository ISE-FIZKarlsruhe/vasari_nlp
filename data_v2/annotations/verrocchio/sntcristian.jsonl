{"id":620,"text":"Andrea del Verrocchio, a Florentine, was in his day a goldsmith, a master of perspective, a sculptor, a wood-carver, a painter, and a musician; but in the arts of sculpture and painting, to tell the truth, he had a manner somewhat hard and crude, as one who acquired it rather by infinite study than by the facility of a natural gift. Even if he had been as poor in this facility as he was rich in the study and diligence that exalted him, he would have been most excellent in those arts, which, for their highest perfection, require a union of study and natural power. If either of these is wanting, a man rarely attains to the first rank; but study will do a great deal, and thus Andrea, who had it in greater abundance than any other craftsman whatsoever, is counted among the rare and excellent masters of our arts. In his youth he applied himself to the sciences, particularly to geometry. Among many other things that he made while working at the goldsmith's art were certain buttons for copes, which are in S. Maria del Fiore at Florence; and he also made larger works, particularly a cup, full of animals, foliage, and other bizarre fancies, which is known to all goldsmiths, and casts are taken of it; and likewise another, on which there is a very beautiful dance of little children. Having given a proof of his powers in these two works, he was commissioned by the Guild of Merchants to make two scenes in silver for the ends of the altar of S. Giovanni, from which, when put into execution, he acquired very great praise and fame. There were wanting at this time in Rome some of those large figures of the Apostles which generally stood on the altar of the Chapel of the Pope, as well as certain other works in silver that had been destroyed; wherefore Pope Sixtus sent for Andrea and with great favour commissioned him to do all that was necessary in this matter, and he brought the whole to perfection with much diligence and judgment.","label":[[0,35,"PER"],[25,35,"PER"],[44,47,"PRON"],[54,63,"PER"],[67,73,"PER"],[77,88,"TECH"],[92,100,"PER"],[104,115,"PER"],[119,126,"PER"],[134,142,"PER"],[155,159,"PROD"],[163,172,"PROD"],[177,185,"PROD"],[343,345,"PRON"],[383,385,"PRON"],[435,438,"PRON"],[440,442,"PRON"],[483,487,"PROD"],[603,606,"PER"],[682,688,"PER"],[698,700,"PRON"],[737,746,"PER"],[799,806,"PER"],[814,818,"PROD"],[823,826,"PRON"],[859,867,"PROD"],[885,893,"PROD"],[924,926,"PRON"],[953,962,"PER"],[965,968,"PROD"],[982,989,"PROD"],[994,999,"PROD"],[1014,1022,"MYTH"],[1014,1044,"FAC"],[1036,1044,"GPE"],[1050,1052,"PRON"],[1070,1075,"PROD"],[1090,1209,"WORK"],[1092,1095,"PROD"],[1105,1112,"ANIM"],[1105,1148,"MOTIF"],[1114,1121,"PLANT"],[1172,1182,"PER"],[1188,1193,"PROD"],[1207,1209,"PRON"],[1268,1273,"PROD"],[1268,1292,"MOTIF"],[1268,1292,"WORK"],[1284,1292,"PER"],[1318,1321,"PRON"],[1342,1347,"PROD"],[1349,1351,"PRON"],[1376,1381,"ORG"],[1376,1394,"ORG"],[1385,1394,"PER"],[1403,1541,"WORK"],[1407,1413,"PROD"],[1407,1413,"PROD"],[1417,1423,"MAT"],[1417,1423,"MAT"],[1444,1449,"FAC"],[1453,1464,"FAC"],[1503,1505,"PRON"],[1562,1574,"TIME"],[1578,1582,"GPE"],[1618,1626,"MYTH"],[1669,1675,"FAC"],[1669,1687,"FAC"],[1683,1687,"MYTH"],[1714,1719,"PROD"],[1723,1729,"MAT"],[1765,1769,"MYTH"],[1765,1776,"MYTH"],[1786,1792,"PER"],[1828,1831,"PRON"],[1881,1883,"PRON"]]}
