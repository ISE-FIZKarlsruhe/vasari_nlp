{"id":722,"text":"So potent are mastery and excellence, even when seen in only one or two works executed to perfection by a man in the art that he practises, that, no matter how small these may be, craftsmen and judges of art are forced to extol them, and writers are compelled to celebrate them and to give praise to the craftsman who has made them; even as we are now about to do for the Venetian Palma. This master, although not very eminent, nor remarkable for perfection of painting, was nevertheless so careful and diligent, and subjected himself so zealously to the labours of art, that a certain proportion of his works, if not all, have something good in them, in that they are close imitations of life and of the natural appearance of men. JACOPO PALMA (PALMA VECCHIO): S. BARBARA (Venice: S. Maria Formosa. Panel) View larger image Palma was much more remarkable for his patience in harmonizing and blending colours than for boldness of design, and he handled colour with extraordinary grace and finish. This may be seen in Venice from many pictures and portraits that he executed for various gentlemen; but of these I shall say nothing more, since I propose to content myself with making mention of some altar-pieces and of a head that I hold to be marvellous, or rather, divine. One of the altar-pieces he painted for S. Antonio, near Castello, at Venice, and another for S. Elena, near the Lido, where the Monks of Monte Oliveto have their monastery. In the latter, which is on the high-altar of that church, he painted the Magi presenting their offerings to Christ, with a good number of figures, among which are some heads truly worthy of praise, as also are the draperies,  executed with a beautiful flow of folds, which cover the figures.","label":[[72,77,"PROD"],[106,109,"PER"],[117,120,"PROD"],[126,128,"PRON"],[180,189,"PER"],[194,200,"PER"],[228,232,"PRON"],[273,277,"PRON"],[304,313,"PER"],[327,331,"PRON"],[341,343,"PRON"],[372,380,"PER"],[372,386,"PER"],[393,399,"PER"],[461,469,"PROD"],[527,534,"PRON"],[566,569,"PROD"],[600,603,"PRON"],[646,650,"PRON"],[660,664,"PRON"],[727,730,"PER"],[732,760,"PER"],[762,772,"MOTIF"],[762,772,"MYTH"],[762,772,"WORK"],[825,830,"PER"],[860,863,"PRON"],[930,936,"PROD"],[942,944,"PRON"],[1017,1023,"GPE"],[1034,1042,"PROD"],[1047,1056,"PROD"],[1062,1064,"PRON"],[1086,1095,"PER"],[1110,1111,"PER"],[1142,1143,"PRON"],[1163,1169,"PRON"],[1198,1210,"PROD"],[1220,1224,"PROD"],[1230,1231,"PRON"],[1274,1349,"WORK"],[1285,1297,"PROD"],[1313,1349,"FAC"],[1330,1338,"GPE"],[1343,1349,"GPE"],[1355,1390,"WORK"],[1367,1390,"FAC"],[1386,1390,"GPE"],[1402,1407,"MYTH"],[1402,1424,"MYTH"],[1411,1424,"GPE"],[1478,1488,"FAC"],[1497,1503,"FAC"],[1516,1737,"WORK"],[1520,1524,"MYTH"],[1520,1737,"MOTIF"],[1555,1561,"PER"],[1585,1592,"PROD"],[1615,1620,"PROD"],[1661,1670,"PROD"],[1730,1737,"PROD"]]}
