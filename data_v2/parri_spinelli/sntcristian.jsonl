{"id":729,"text":"Parri di Spinello Spinelli, painter of Arezzo, having learnt the first principles of art from his own father, was brought to Florence by the agency of Messer Leonardo Bruni of Arezzo, and was received by Lorenzo Ghiberti into his school, where many young men were learning under his discipline: and since the doors of S. Giovanni were then being given their finish, he was put to labour on those figures, in company with many others, as it has been said above. And having, in this work, contracted a friendship with Masolino da Panicale, and being pleased with his method of drawing, he set about imitating him in many respects, as he also imitated in others the manner of Don Lorenzo degli Angeli. Parri made his figures much longer and more slender than any painter who had lived before him, and whereas the others make them in the proportion of ten heads at most, he gave them eleven, and sometimes twelve; nor did this make them awkward, although they were slender and were ever bent in an arch either to the right side or to the left, for the reason that this, as it appeared to him, and as he himself said, gave them more vigour. The flow of his draperies was very delicate, with abundance of folds, which fell from the arms of his figures right down to the feet. He coloured very well in distemper, and perfectly in fresco, and he was the first who, in working in fresco, ceased to use verdaccio below flesh-colours, to be afterwards washed over with rosy flesh-tints in chiaroscuro, in the manner of water-colours, as Giotto and the other old masters had done. Parri, on the other hand, used body colours in making his grounds and tints, placing them with much discretion where it appeared to him that they would look bestâ€”that is, the lights on the highest points, the middle tints towards the sides, and the darks on the outlines; with which method of painting he showed more facility in his works and gave longer life to pictures in fresco, seeing that, having laid the colours in their places, he would blend them together with a rather thick and soft brush, and would execute his works with so high a finish that nothing better can be desired; and his colouring has no equal. Parri, then, having been absent many years from his country, was recalled by his relatives, after the death of his father, to Arezzo, where, besides many works which it would take too long to recount, he made some which do not in any way deserve to be passed over in silence.","label":[[0,45,"PER"],[9,26,"PER"],[28,35,"PER"],[39,45,"GPE"],[85,88,"PROD"],[94,97,"PRON"],[102,108,"PER"],[125,133,"GPE"],[151,157,"PER"],[151,182,"PER"],[176,182,"GPE"],[204,220,"PER"],[226,229,"PRON"],[230,236,"FAC"],[249,258,"PER"],[255,258,"PER"],[279,282,"PRON"],[283,293,"PROD"],[309,314,"FAC"],[318,329,"FAC"],[352,357,"PRON"],[366,368,"PRON"],[396,403,"PROD"],[437,439,"PRON"],[481,485,"PROD"],[516,536,"PER"],[528,536,"GPE"],[561,564,"PRON"],[575,582,"PROD"],[584,586,"PRON"],[607,610,"WORK"],[632,634,"PRON"],[673,696,"MYTH"],[699,704,"PER"],[710,713,"PRON"],[714,721,"PROD"],[760,767,"PER"],[789,792,"PRON"],[822,826,"PRON"],[867,869,"PRON"],[875,879,"PRON"],[928,932,"PRON"],[951,955,"PRON"],[1084,1087,"PRON"],[1096,1098,"PRON"],[1148,1151,"PRON"],[1152,1161,"PROD"],[1234,1237,"PRON"],[1238,1245,"PROD"],[1270,1272,"PRON"],[1295,1304,"TECH"],[1323,1329,"TECH"],[1371,1377,"TECH"],[1478,1489,"TECH"],[1526,1532,"PER"],[1547,1558,"PER"],[1569,1574,"PER"],[1623,1626,"PRON"],[1654,1658,"PRON"],[1686,1688,"PRON"],[1701,1704,"PRON"],[1710,1714,"PRON"],[1862,1870,"PROD"],[1871,1873,"PRON"],[1898,1901,"PRON"],[1902,1907,"PROD"],[1932,1940,"PROD"],[1944,1950,"TECH"],[2006,2008,"PRON"],[2064,2069,"PROD"],[2089,2092,"PRON"],[2093,2098,"PROD"],[2161,2164,"PRON"],[2189,2194,"PER"],[2237,2240,"PRON"],[2241,2248,"GPE"],[2266,2269,"PRON"],[2270,2279,"PER"],[2281,2310,"TIME"],[2304,2310,"PER"],[2315,2321,"GPE"],[2343,2348,"PROD"],[2355,2357,"PRON"],[2390,2392,"PRON"]]}
